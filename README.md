# Woven-EndoBridge-Aneurysm-Occlusion-Probability-Calculator
Background:
Endovascular treatment with the Woven Endobridge (WEB) device has been widely utilized for managing intracranial aneurysms. However, predicting the probability of achieving adequate occlusion (Raymond-Roy classification I or II) remains challenging. Objective:
Our study sought to develop and validate a predictive calculator for determining adequate occlusion using the WEB device via data from a large multi-institutional retrospective cohort.
Methods:
We used data from the WorldWideWEB Consortium, encompassing 359 patients from 30 centers across North America, South America, and Europe. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed on a variety of demographic and clinical factors, from which predictive factors were selected. Calibration and validation were conducted, with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) parameters checked for collinearity.
Results:
Twelve variables, including male gender, age ≥ 65 years old, current smoker status, ruptured aneurysm at presentation, Hunt and Hess score, mRS score, bifurcation aneurysm type, presence of multiple aneurysms, maximum aneurysm diameter, presence of daughter sac, femoral access, and use of adjunctive device were included in the final analyses. In the multivariate regression, age ≥ 65 (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.52, p < 0.0001), Hunt and Hess score II (OR: 15.16, 95% CI: 1.12 to 224.27, p=0.040 ) and use of adjunctive device (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.58, p < 0.0001 ) emerged as significant predictors of adequate occlusion. The predictive calculator demonstrated reliable discriminative ability with a c-statistic of 0.7671. All VIF parameters were measured below 5, ensuring no collinearity. The calculator is available for use at: https://neurodx.shinyapps.io/WEBDEVICE/
Conclusion:
Ultimately, this predictive calculator offers a substantial contribution to the clinical toolkit for estimating the likelihood of obtaining adequate intracranial aneurysm occlusion when using WEB device embolization. It aims to enhance clinicians’ decision-making by providing an evidence-based, quantified prediction model. Despite this, it is crucial to interpret and apply its outputs prudently, considering the ultimate clinical decision rests with the neurointerventionalist provider. Accordingly, we acknowledge the need for future work to build a more robust model that can be accurately applied across varied populations and clinical settings.
